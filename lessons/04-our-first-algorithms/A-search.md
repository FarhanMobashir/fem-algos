### Algorithms
We are entering into the A of DSA!  A lot of the algorithms will first be
described on the whiteboard and then translated into code.

Its a very good practice to get into is being able to visualize the problem,
discuss it with boxes and arrows, and then program it.  Its definitely a core
competency that will follow you for life.

We will also be doing a group of algorithms together, that way we can have the
same mentality for a bit.

### Is it ordered?
So this is an extremely important question to be asked.  Is the array ordered?
If it is, we have options that we don't have if its unordered.

### Possibly the simpliest algo, Linear Search
As I said, lets whiteboard this.

### Lets implement it
To the typescripts!

### What is the Big O for Linear Search?
... this is a free one ...

Lets whiteboard why this is it.
