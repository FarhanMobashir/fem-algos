### If you say priority queue in an interview, I'll hire you
This is sort of a joke, but also not.

### The Heap DataStructure
The simplest way to put it is a binary tree where every child and grand child
is smaller (MaxHeap), or larger (MinHeap) than the current node.

* Whenever a node is added, we must adjust the tree
* Whenever a node is deleted, we must adjust the tree
* There is no traversing the tree

### Some cool characteristics
* It is self balancing
* It can be used for priority
* I personally think its one of the harder data structures to implement
