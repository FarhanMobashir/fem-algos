## We did it!
We are done with lists...


but in a sense... the next data structure is a list with multiple paths...

### All programming eventually leads to trees
I swear, every complex project I have ever worked on ends up being a tree
exercise.  I hope you are ready!  This is where we really have to put all of
our skills together.

### Where are trees?
* Your filesystem is a tree
* The dom is a tree
* Trees are massively important in compilers.  You have probably mininumly
  heard the term Abstract Syntax Tree.
* and there is more...

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### Lets do a quick whiteboard example to solidify it.
Just in case none of those examples stuck with you

<br/>

### Terminology
root - the most parent node. The First. Adam.
height - The longest path from the root to the most child node
binary tree - a tree in which has at most 2 children, at least 0 children
general tree - a tree with 0 or more children
binary search tree - a tree in which has a specific ordering to the nodes and at most 2 children
leaves - a node without children

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### Specific Tree Type: Binary Tree
(whiteboard)

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### Traversals
there are different ways in which you can visit the nodes of a tree.
* pre order
* in order
* post order
(whiteboard)

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### Lets code for a second
Lets create all three different traversals!

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### These types of traversals are known as
Depth First Search.  But that isn't the only * First search there is!  Breadth
first search.
(whiteboard)

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### Lets implement
* dfs (in order)
* bfs

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### PRACTICE PROBLEM!
This use to be a very common problem in the hiring world.

* Comparing two binary trees to see if they are equal in both shape and
  structure.
