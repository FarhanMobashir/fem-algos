## I am back
And I am going to whiteboard so hard today, and i hope you are ready for it.

For me, whiteboarding algos is one of the best activities.

<br/>

## Why should I care about algorithms?
* Isn't asking algorithms old fashion for interviews?
* I don't actually use any of them on the job right?

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

### Three things
* Lots of companies still very much so use algos to judge problem solving
  skills, and my guess this wont change much in the next 20 year.

* Do you even array, bro?
  * `const arr = []` <--- NOT AN ARRAY

* How does a JavaScript lists work?
  * if you know the answer, don't say anything.
  * We will observationally ascertain the correct ds under the hood.

### Remember, Arrays are the simpliest Data Structure

## Time and Space Complexity
* there will be no proofs
* there will be graphs though

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### The Languages we will use
* Yes I did say languages...
* C for talking about arrays
* TS for the rest

#### Why C though?
Its truly the language that is best to learn datastructures in, but requires a
done of precursor knowledge.  Memory layout is really important and its the
easiest to observe in C (which is also why C is so hard).
