## How we will crush such great feats
We are going to be cruising through a small cli program that will help you be
able to grasp these languages.

### Before we begin, lets take a quick poll.
* Who came here to learn rust, potentially better?
* How much rust do you know?
* Who came here to learn go, potentially better?
* How much go do you know?
* Who knows ts?

## Where did this course come from?
As I have mentioned i stream and make yt videos.  I get asked this question constantly.

* What should I learn next?
* How should I learn it?
* What should I build?
* Where do I start?

## I love building cli apps
They are a great way to get to learn the ecosystem.

## Roadmap
### Part 1 : Getting familiar
* We will solve some simple string parsing problems.  This will help us just get
  acquainted with each language.

### Part 2 : Testing in each language
* Testing in each language
* Strategies of testing

### Part 3 : CLI Application - Parsing command line arguments
We will start the cli program the best way we can, CLI arguments.  This is
where the rubber will meet the road.

### Part 4 : The Config and Add operation
### Part 5 : The rest of the operations
### Part 6 : Conclusion

## My One Regret
The hardest part about making this talk is that there isnt going to be
concurrency.  Which means we don't get the opportunity to explore go routines
and tokio tears.  This is where Golang will quickly become your most favorited
language of all time.

If this course goes well and is a great way to understand and make these jumps
to other languages, perhaps we can come back and make a web application.

### Why I didn't
Rust will likely eat up most of our time.  Not because we have to write a
significant amount of code, but because its so hard at first.  So to set us up
for success, I wanted confine this to a specific boundary set that is most
consumable from a typescript perspective.

## So its time

## WAIT
do you have rust installed?
do you have go installed?

Now would be an excellent time to get that done.  In fact, I think we should
take a quick small break just to ensure it happens.
