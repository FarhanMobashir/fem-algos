### Real talk
How many of you are now interested in using vim after seeing that sweet sweet
coconut oil'd experience?

### What's next?
Shockingly, we only touched the simple data structures of computer science.  I
tried to cram every inch of possible Data Structures in such a short period of
time.

<br/>
<br/>

### Part 2?
Part 2 will be something that is more involved in graph data structures,
dynamic programming (i have always found this to be the hardest concept), and
other fun DSAs out there.

### For now
Vim on and prosper
(i also teach a class on vim... did i mention that?)
