### Intro
* blah blah blah something about me on twitch and yt and something like that.
* Roadmap
* Why TypeScript?

### Algorithms: Lingo and Definitions
* Time and Space complexity
- light introduction.
- big O notation.
- explain constant, logn, n, nlogn, n^2, k^n, !n
* Recursion
- perhaps one of the hardest hurdles in all programming to get over.
- perhaps one of the most useful programming concepts.
- simple examples of recursion
- where recursion is great

### First Algorithm
* Insertion sort
* Time and Space

### Second Algorithm
* Merge Sort
* Time and Space

### Check Point
* How are we feeling?  This is really happening, we are most certainly going to
  go all the way here!
